# samwise-structures
No code here, just issue tracking for the Structures team. Issues can be created and organized in the corresponding Structures project: https://github.com/orgs/stanford-ssi/projects/14

**Guidelines for Issue Tickets**

Each ticket should include several elements so that we have a clear idea of problems and progress:

- **Title:** Brief but specific (e.g. "Z tray tolerance interaction with standoffs" rather than "Z tray issue").

The following two items should be added as Labels:
- **Time Estimate:** XS (sub-hour) through XL (weeks)
- **Priority:** 0 (critical) through 3 (luxury)

The following four items should be in the body text of the issue:
- **Assignee:** Put yourself in the "Assignees" field when creating the issue, then list other relevant people here. Also note if collaboration with other sub-teams is necessary.
- **Description:** Describe the issue, including enough details that people who weren't present when the issue was discovered can understand.
- **Action Plan:** Steps towards a solution--can be vague at first and updated as progress is made.

Once the issue is created, **mark today's date and a preliminary deadline (which can be changed later) in the Timeline view of the project:** https://github.com/orgs/stanford-ssi/projects/14/views/2. Also add a parent issue (e.g. CAD tasks) if applicable.

Issues are placed in To Do when initially created and moved to In Progress as they are worked on. One of the co-leads (Lisa or Nate) will move issues to Done.
