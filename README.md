# samwise-structures
No code here, just issue tracking for the Structures team. Issues can be created and organized in the corresponding Structures project: https://github.com/orgs/stanford-ssi/projects/14

**Guidelines for Issue Tickets**

Each ticket should include several elements so that we have a clear idea of problems and progress:

- **Title:** Brief but specific (e.g. "Z tray tolerance interaction with standoffs" rather than "Z tray issue").
- **Assignee:** The person or people in charge of fixing the issue. **Also note in the description if collaboration with other sub-teams is necessary.**

The following two items should be added as Labels:
- **Time Estimate:** XS (sub-hour) through XL (weeks)
- **Priority:** 0 (critical) through 3 (luxury)

The following three items should be in the body text of the issue:
- **Description:** Describe the issue, including enough details that people who weren't present when the issue was discovered can understand.
- **Action Plan:** Steps towards a solution--can be vague at first and updated as progress is made.
- **Due Date:** An initial deadline for fixing the issue. Can be updated as progress is made.

Issues are placed in To Do when initially created and moved to In Progress as they are worked on. One of the co-leads (Lisa or Nate) will move issues to Done.
